April Cook was born in Kokomo, Indiana in 1979. She knew as far back as she could remember,
that she wanted to help people. When she finished high school in 1998, she went to college to
be a paramedic. She loved working with and helping the people of her community. It was hard
work, and it could be very emotional when she would lose a patient.</p>

<p>After a few years of being a paramedic, she enrolled in school to be an LPN. She worked
for an Obstetrician at the local hospital, helping care for pregnant patients and their 
babies. She loved it.</p>

<p>In 2009, she decided it was time to go back to school to become an RN so she could work
with patients at a higher level, and better money. She excelled in Nursing School and started
her career as an RN in 2011.</p>

<p>She had been in the medical field for years now, so her past experience along with her new
degree lead to her getting promoted to management positions very quickly. She had been a nurse
for less than 6 months when she was promoted to Unit Manager. Within 2 years after that, she
had managed to get promoted to the Assistant Director of Nursing. This is the 3rd highest position
in a long term care facility.</p>

<p>12 years later, she still only has an Associate degree, but is at the top of the ladder in the
nursing field. She accomplished all of this all while starting a new family with 4 step-kids,
and giving birth while in nursing school.</p>

<p>April is the perfect example of when you set your mind to something you love, you can achieve
it with hard work and dedication.</p>

<p>She plans to eventually go back to school. She either wants to get her Bachelors degree, or
aim higher and get her degree as a nurse anesthetist. A nurse anesthetist administers anesthesia to
patients during surgery.
Her eventual goal is to find a remote nursing job so she can travel and spend more time with family.
